# Andermatt, a Ski Town with Two Wheels
I've always had an fascination for Switzerland, particularly for the mountains or, more simply, "the Alps". At least that's what I assumed when growing up. I didn't realize that the Alps existed anywhere other than the "Swiss Alps"! So when considering a bike tour into Switzerland and after having finally had some exposure to this part of the world, I had to figure out where a good "base camp" was for a road cycling adventure.

Enter the town of [Andermatt](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6pXoDwXnzrvYtMeS8). It's primarily a ski town, since it sits at 1444 meters (4737 feet) above sea level and is well connected to several ski slops within the (quite literal) heart of the Alps of Switzerland.

{{< img >}}

Luckily for us road cyclists, the snow eventually melts, revealing beautifully kept and engineered Swiss roads just begging to be ridden. This was it! My "base camp". This makes Andermatt a _must stop_ when considering a cycling holiday in this part of the world!

Just remember when traveling, particularly [with a big bike box]({{< ref "/blog/Guides/Getting_Around_Bike_Box/index.md" >}}), it's always a good idea to stay close to public transit. Despite having about a half mile, cobblestone-lined walk to our AirBnB, the town is small enough and accessible enough to not make the transfer too difficult. 

## So...What's Nearby?
What makes this town so good for cycling is its proximity to nearly all of the most-known cycling climbs of Switzerland, particularly the ones most often featured in the [Tour de Suisse](https://www.tourdesuisse.ch/en/). If you stay in town, you can pretty much just roll out of your hotel and start climbing in nearly any direction! It's truly amazing when I pause to reflect back on the trip.

However, it may be a bit daunting at first planning out a bunch of routes when you may not know the region. I spent a lot of time [planning my trip to Switzerland in 2024]({{< ref "/travel/Switzerland/Tour_2024/index.md" >}}), and had to "connect the dots" myself on the various climbs and routes of the region.

So in the interest of saving you, my fantastic reader, some time, I'll share my personal experience on each of the climbs, with routes you can connect to each, along with simply sharing what I did this past summer in 2024.

Keep in mind that each of these can be reached directly from Andermatt without requiring any direct transit connections, unless choosing to shorten a route for whatever reason!

### "If it's not on Strava, did you even ride?"
While in Andermatt, we did three days of riding, splitting the first day up into two separate rides because the Nufenenpass was closed that particular day. Luckily the trains were so good that we were still able to do plenty of riding that day!

- [Furkapass to Oberwald](https://www.strava.com/activities/11805786501), back via a train to Hospental, 24 miles, 3200 feet
- [Gotthardpass from Hospental to Airolo](https://www.strava.com/activities/11807436528), back via another train to Göschenen, 15 miles, 2100 feet
- [Sustenpass, Grimselpass, Furkapass](https://www.strava.com/activities/11815322093), 75 miles, 12,300 feet
- [Oberalppass and Lukmanierpass to Biasca](https://www.strava.com/activities/11821726199), back via train, 58 miles, 5000 feet

Note that the "Big Three" passes in Switzerland are the Furkapass, Grimselpass, and Sustenpass, all three of which can be done in a [single, large ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/3659761505) if you're up for it (~80 miles, 12k feet of climbing).

Enough of that, let's talk about the climbs themselves!

### Furkapass
If there is one singular pass that is _the_ most famous from this region, it's this one. Known for being featured in the James Bond movie Goldfinger, it's a beautiful, meandering climb at an average 7% when approaching from Andermatt. It's also the highest-elevation climb of the region at 2429 meters (7967 feet), outside of the Nufenenpass.

{{< yt id="E1KZOSGIOUM" >}}

You first travel out of town along a straight section of fairly fast-traveled road where wind can definitely set you back a bit. If this is the first ride at elevation, you may start to notice some early fatigue setting in (I know I did!). The road quickly passes an old steam train line and then travels under the mountain, heading up pretty quickly and evenly, giving you better and better views out over the valley eastward towards the towns of Hospental and Andermatt.

Along the way, make sure to stop by the [James Bond lookout](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QhDfadBQytURC4W57) (someone put up a "James Bond St" road sign) and be mindful of the many (often fancy) cars doing the same touring you're doing. It's quite popular on weekends, so be visible of course and be ready for some close passes, more particularly towards the top where the road seems to _feel_ narrower. 

Luckily the whole valley is quite open, so you can hear cars coming up from below well before they reach you.

Towards the top you'll start to see snow packed on the side of the road, so make sure to have an extra layer on you even if the sun is out! Descending down the other side if quite open, fast, and fun, but is less steep by comparison, closer to 5.8% in case you plan to come back up the same direction back to Andermatt.

- [Strava Segment from Gletsch](https://www.strava.com/segments/18259669) (other direction)

#### My Thoughts
Personally, this felt more difficult for me than I had expected it to be. It was my first real climb of the high mountains on this particular trip and my pacing may have been off. But I stopped enough for pictures that I was able to take it easy and enjoy the valley as I got higher and higher. Some of the road's turns provided amazing views, but don't underestimate them if you feel a bit unsettled by heights!

Note that the famous [Belvedere Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4pxcsB46RAxycWMy8) is on the other (west) side of the Furkapass, so if you want to stop for a picture, keep that in mind. You'll see it coming on the way down with plenty of time to spare (it's actually the same view you'll notice in the very first few seconds of the Goldfinger clip above!).

If you dismount and walk up the stairs towards the gift shop, you can actually pop out on to a balcony that will afford you views out towards the [Rhône Glacier](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xVm9Afsr2X3yw2Zg6). As long as you don't go through the turnstile out back, you won't have to pay the entrance fee. It's a beautiful spot that actually showcases a lot of [really interesting history](https://lamont.columbia.edu/news/rhone-glacier-finely-tuned-climate-changes) around global climate change. Definitely check it out if you have a moment!

#### Where to Go from Here
Once descending down the far side of the Furkapass into the town of [Gletsch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fnxyb86bvzYKorJD7), I can recommend at least 4 options to go:
- head back up the way you came
- head up the [Grimselpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JgLpP5Nwki7PXHbc8), descend down the other side, then go up the backside of the Sustenpass back towards [Göschenen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7fWwGkfRzaoQ9xPq9) and eventually Andermatt
- head down to [Oberwald](https://maps.app.goo.gl/46iKHWwAEWGbvyFU6), climb the [Nufenenpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aTD2oWPwRxdSR5pL7), descend down the other side, then back up the cobbled [Gotthardpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LPx9aceRW16NkuZRA) from [Airolo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rWPEtcHMUeAVL8Jx8) towards Andermatt
- take a shortcut, head down to the [Oberwald](https://maps.app.goo.gl/46iKHWwAEWGbvyFU6) train station and take the train back to [Hospental](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NG7Uz54SmAxGSesM8), riding back to Andermatt from there.

There are obviously more options to consider here if you're willing to ride further towards another train station and find another way back to Andermatt via transit. For example, from the base of the Grimselpass, you could feasibly ride up and continue northward into [Innertkirchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2vVoLJFErSVYjEy9) and [Meiringen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CR6hrnFmZLrHn6ck6), both of which are just east of Lake Brienz, potentially connecting you back [towards the Interlaken area]({{< ref "/travel/Switzerland/Interlaken/index.md" >}}).
- Transit going from Lake Brienz to Andermatt is actually a bit circuitous if considering only trains, but a nice commuter bus is usually available (it's what we took to get to Andermatt initially), driving you back up and over the Sustenpass to Andermatt.

Check the map and the SBB mobile app for what you'd like to consider, read my [other blog about transit in Switzerland]({{< ref "/travel/Switzerland/Transit/index.md" >}}), and remember that most fast-traveling trains take you to Göschenen directly before requiring you to connect via an older line up the mountain further to Andermatt. It's actually an amazing ride through a valley of waterfalls, a glacial-fed river, and old stone bridges, like something out of Lord of the Rings!

### Sustenpass
Out of all the climbs of the region, I think the [Sustenpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/o4ywk1yASnb5Mj4k8) had some of the most expansive views and certainly _the_ most amazing descent down the other side. It apparently was an old mule route that became modernized over time to help assist with transport of supplies during WWII, topping out at 2264 meters (7427 feet) above sea level.

If approaching the Sustenpass from [Wassen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VJmJMxXH69EieYfG7) like we did, it's a bit steeper and shorter, at about 7.2% and 11 miles (18 km). If coming from the other side near [Innertkirchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q1aAEL1GpfwWBzBU6), it's a bit less steep at 5.6%, but longer at 17 miles (28 km). 

We actually came into Andermatt from Interlaken the day before via a bus that went directly up and over the Sustenpass. This gave us an early glimpse into what it would be like to ride (while also getting quite a tour from our bus driver!). It's truly an amazing climb when coming from Andermatt, and while we didn't stop for pictures on the way up, I have incredible memories of snaking my way up the climb.

When coming from Andermatt, you actually descend very quickly through some car tunnels and switchbacks following the Reuss river through an amazing rock-lined valley. It was seriously amazing, so please don't skip this part and take the train if you're trying to save some mileage! Once reaching [Wassen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VJmJMxXH69EieYfG7), the official climb begins. After meandering through a few more tunnels, the road opens up and follows the outside of a large valley that just goes around and _up_.

{{< img >}}

The pass is reasonably well traveled, and I don't remember a ton of space being afforded to me as a cyclist, but the visibility along the road was really good and given that it's a major bus line, the traffic seems generally aware of hikers (yes, buses will stop for them at bus stops!), bikers, and other cars.

There are two large switchbacks towards the top, signifying that you're getting close. You'll also likely come across some snow, even in the height of summer!

#### My Thoughts
I felt a certain affinity for the Sustenpass, probably because we first got to experience it from a commuter bus the day prior. The day was foggy, a bit wet, and very _moody_. Definitely gave it a really interesting vibe, and also showcased to us that we slightly underestimated just how cold the mountains were going to be that time of the year. We promptly raided the sports gear stores in Andermatt once we arrived!

The weather was really nice the day we went up on our bikes, and the first part where we descended into Wassen and then climbed through several tunnels was something out of another world. Referring back to Lord of the Rings again, it honestly felt a bit like [Rivendell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivendell) at times!

We didn't stop and did some good pacelining up the climb, so I definitely felt accomplished that day, somewhat differently than when I reached the top of the Furkapass the day prior. I made sure to get a picture of my bike with the wall of snow that had been piled high alongside the many beautiful cars that were sharing the parking lot with us at the top.

My favorite part though? The descent down the other side. 100%. It was probably _the longest_ descent I've ever done in my life. It was fast, smooth, and despite requiring an extended amount of focus time, I remember actively being shocked at just how much of it was spent in my "[flow state](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/flow-state)". 

The roads in Switzerland are just something of another caliber - in small amounts and at slower speeds they just seem like "nice roads", but you don't really fully appreciate them until you're on them for an extended period of time and at speed. It's especially apparently on the bike because you're just so much more connected to your surroundings. It's a bit difficult to describe here, but it's something every serious cyclist must experience in their lifetime.

It also was shocking to me at just how much uphill traffic was waiting that we observed from the other side. There were a few timed lights on the way down that definitely made for a slower ascent, so I'm really glad we did it the direction we did that day!

#### Where to Go From Here
Of course, you can always just head back the way you came, but that gets tricky when considering riding back up the climb into Andermatt from Wassen. Not impossible of course, but the bike path along the road there looks quite narrow and the road itself can get quite busy around the switchbacks. So it may be best to continue onward and experience more of the big climbs of Swizerland. I'd recommend:

- Descending down the west side towards [Innertkirchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2vVoLJFErSVYjEy9), climbing up and over the [Grimselpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JgLpP5Nwki7PXHbc8), and then back up and over the [Furkapass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EKnQyDBXaEZpxzBK8) to Andermatt.
- Do the same route as above, but take [Nufenenpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZyPDdG7LBXhs17Hh6) over towards [Gotthardpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/96ac6XP9DQPQsb9x5) and back up and over (a huge day, although you could take the train back from [Airolo](https://www.strava.com/activities/11807436528) at that point).
- Head over the [Grimselpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JgLpP5Nwki7PXHbc8), but continue down towards [Oberwald](https://maps.app.goo.gl/46iKHWwAEWGbvyFU6) and take the train back to [Hospental](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NG7Uz54SmAxGSesM8) towards Andermatt.
- To shorten the ride, head down into [Innertkirchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2vVoLJFErSVYjEy9) and take public transit back to Andermatt, either via a direct bus or a train (or set of trains) around towards [Göschenen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7fWwGkfRzaoQ9xPq9) and Andermatt.

### Grimselpass
If there were a single phrase to describe the north side of the Grimselpass, it would be _amazing infrastructure_. The road is fantastic and there are a ton of hydroelectric dams and water everywhere. In fact, one of them was actually still being built, which is something I've never seen before!

{{< img >}}

The north side of the pass, if you consider it starting from [Innertkirchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2vVoLJFErSVYjEy9), is significantly longer than from [Gletsch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fnxyb86bvzYKorJD7), on the south side near the base of the Furkapass. Strava shows it as nearly 27 km and 1587 meters, but with a fairly mild overall average gradient of 5.7%. Much longer compared to the other side, which only clocks in at about 6 km and 405 meters, averaging a slightly steeper 6.4%.

But hey, the descent down the west side of the Sustenpass into Innertkirchen was worth it, right?

When heading up from [Innertkirchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2vVoLJFErSVYjEy9) on the north side of the pass, you start in a valley that's quite low compared to the passes previously mentioned. It's also quite green and very enveloping. I remember looking way up at the passes above and seeing power lines and funiculars that stretched up into the sky.

There are a few tunnels and some switchbacks through this region, and you actually pass the [Gelmerbahn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NDAVPn9Azst7PPT8A), which is apparently the steepest open-air funicular! We obviously didn't go that day, but it looks like an [insane ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv5zqwIP-Lk).

As for the tunnels, I don't remember them being too bad to ride through, even though there wasn't much room for us. Just make sure you have good rear lights for them and to take any side route when available. Besides, the views from the side paths are absolutely stunning! Note that some of the side routes are across the other side of the road and are mixed dirt / grass, so we didn't take them that day, but you're welcome to give them a go if you don't feel comfortable in the tunnels.

The longest of the tunnels, by the way, is close to a kilometer long! Most are well-lit, and I remember riding through a few of them without seeing any cars in either direction. But, as always, your mileage may vary! And how cool is it that all the tunnels here show the meters to either end every 50 meters inside?

Gradually, you ascend up out of the trees (and tunnels) and you begin to notice more and more rock and fewer trees. There's a ton of natural beauty there, and I loved seeing the myriad of colors that these geological features really highlight.

The climb does start to feel a bit longer at this point, though, so keep yourself prepared for that! You'll get close to the dams and eventually ascend up and over them into their respective lakes, both the Räterichsbodensee and the Grimselsee. It's so cool to see the road just snake its way up the side of what looks like rock, with cars lining the road at this point, showcasing where the road is going next.

{{< img >}}

After a few final switchbacks, you make it to the top, at the Totensee lake! Apparently it's known as the "lake of the dead" due to a battle where the losing side was pushed back into it during the [first battle of Ulrichen in 1211](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Battle_of_Ulrichen). Insane how much history exists in this region!

- [Strava segment from Gletsch](https://www.strava.com/segments/21822371)

Even in the summer you'll see ice in the water, so bring a layer or two for the descent! There is a nice restaurant at the top for some celebratory libations or food and a few gift shop / snack stands if you want something quicker.

{{< img >}}

The descent back down into Gletsch, which is coincidentally also at the base of the Furkapass, is a fast, open set of long switchbacks looking out over the valley. It's marvelous.

#### My Thoughts
Because the Grimselpass from this direction starts at a physically lower elevation than some of the other climbs we had done previously, this one definitely felt long. But it was never too difficult. Without stops, however, it becomes more of a patience game, and you'll definitely want to find time to stop and admire the amazing landscape that you ascend up to when you get close to the various hydroelectric dams.

I did my best that day to follow my buddy I was on the trip with, but eventually did stop for a few pictures to admire the landscape and eventually caught back up with him towards the top. I noticed the traffic seemed to become busier weirdly enough the closer we got to the top of the climb. Perhaps it's a later-afternoon kind of trip for people.

I loved this one as well, but mainly because doing it this way allowed me to enjoy the long descent down the west side of the Sustenpass. I also particularly loved the energy at the top here, which seemed more open and somewhat similar to how I remember the top of the [Stelvio]({{< ref "/travel/Italy/Velodrom_Italian_Job_2022/index.md" >}}). Seeing floating ice in the lake at the top in the middle of summer was also fun, and it was nice that there were food options at the top.

Final thought - enjoy the descent back into Gletsch as well. There's a fantastic set of views towards the top just before the big switchbacks into the valley. It's not often that you get to look over across an alpine valley towards another world-famous climb that sits next to a glacier!

#### Where to Go from Here
Most likely from here, you'll be heading down the shorter, slightly steeper side into the town of Gletsch, which also sits at the base of the Furkapass. You can generally head back any way you wish from here, depending on what your plans are, but they're largely going to be similar to the ones mentioned above!

In our case, we headed down to the valley floor then ascended up the Furkapass from there. We had gone down that way the day prior, so we wanted to head up the way we came to say that we had done both sides of the Furkapass!

### Gotthardpass
Everyone knows the infamous cobbles of the Paris-Roubaix, but have you heard of the cobbles on the Gotthardpass? Imagine smaller, more uniform stones, hammered in _by hand_, and maintained by Swiss engineers in the same fashion today as they always have been. I even witnessed a small crew doing exactly this, one stone at a time.

It's a fascinating place with a fascinating history, as it's one of the primary passes that effectively connects northern Europe to southern Europe, and has been generally been in use by people since medieval times. It's also a place where the Swiss have managed to make architectural achievements first of their kind, with three separate tunnels through the pass in addition to the historic road that you as a cyclist will more likely enjoy - especially since very few cars tend to drive on it!

On the first day of riding from Andermatt, we had planned to do a large loop over Furkapass towards the Nufenenpass, making our way back over the south approach of the Gotthardpass. Unfortunately on that day, the Nufenenpass was closed. We instead took a train back from Oberwald to Hospental and opted to do a "quick" up and over the Gotthardpass to experience this feat of Swiss engineering first hand, taking the train right back under the mountain to get back to Andermatt via [Göschenen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7fWwGkfRzaoQ9xPq9).

Apparently heading this direction is somewhat less common, as taking the original cobbled road is a bit jarring on the bike. Or so my Singapore-based friend who has frequented this region a lot told me. I think if you manage to pace it more quickly, the cobbles don't feel so pronounced, but the southern face of the old road definitely has far more cobbles than the northern face.

A good portion of the climb from Hospental is actually along a newer section of road that meanders along the valley upwards towards the pass where you start to see snow and some huge wind generators. Definitely look for the turn off for the old road to experience this - it may not be as fast as the newer road, but it's definitely the experience you want to have with this pass.

Heading down the south side is a treat, just pay attention to further down when newer pavement starts to show up. It will surprise you when cobbles show back up again, after you've naturally picked up more speed! The views through this region are incredible and the switchbacks in the road, in my opinion, rival closely to that of Sa Colabra in Mallorca! I'm not sure why this isn't more advertised, to be honest.

{{< img >}}

If you want to do what we did, head all the way down to the bottom, take _all_ of the pictures, and head back towards the train station stop at Airolo. Suddenly everyone is speaking Italian and you'll feel yourself ready to justify sitting down at a cafe and ordering some pasta. _Grazie, mille!_

#### My Thoughts
I liked doing this climb in a bit more of a free-form fashion. The train access through this region is fantastic and gives you a ton of options for route creation, despite being quite nestled in the mountains of the Alps.

The beauty on the south side of this climb was some of the best that I found on this trip, believe it or not. Perhaps it was golden hour that particular day, but the light cascading down through the valley and over the _many_ switchbacks was just something to admire and behold. There were basically no cars out there and it felt like the entire road was out there just for us.

That being said, however, I _did_ find the cobbles still pretty jarring. I had started to struggle at the start of the climb that day, so I felt more fatigued upon getting started, but definitely livened up a bit on the descent. I think descending them, for me, was more manageable than moving as slowly as I was going up them. So going up the longer way with more cobbles probably would not have been as enjoyable for me. At least on that day. Your mileage will vary of course!

#### Where to Go from Here

### Oberalppass

### Lukmanierpass


The big climbs of the region are generally these:
- [Sustenpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/o4ywk1yASnb5Mj4k8)
- [Grimselpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/98Rg3fbzycU24QN19)
- [Gotthardpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/96ac6XP9DQPQsb9x5)
- [Oberalppass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8b52Lj38B2jqj5QV7)
- [Lukmanierpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/thveKJCgSmUnmJXr6)
- [Nufenenpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZyPDdG7LBXhs17Hh6)

If you head west, you can hit the Furkapass, featured in the James Bond movie Goldfinger.

Go North and you can enjoy an amazing descent into [Göschenen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7fWwGkfRzaoQ9xPq9) and [Wassen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zYq2ZB6hW4MZHnhQ6) before starting the Sustenpass climb.

Go East and you can climb the Oberalppass, following a tram to an alpine lake and the world's highest lighthouse.

Head south (after going west to [Hospental](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NG7Uz54SmAxGSesM8)) and you can reach the famous cobbled Roman road connection to Italy, the Gotthardpass.

Further, what makes this area so interesting and unique is that despite being in the rugged alpine terrain, you're never far from public transit and you have multiple road passes that can connect all of these into huge, epic loops! 

You can connect the Sustenpass to the Furkapass via the Grimselpass. Similarly, you can connect the Furkapass to the Gotthardpass via the Nufenenpass. You can also connect the Oberalppass to the Gotthardpass via the Lukmanierpass.

Absolutely amazing if you ask me.

## When to Go
Because these passes are often encumbered by snow, making them impassable, make sure to time these with the summer high season. Most of the time late June into early July these passes are all open before starting to close again in September or October. Keep in mind that if you plan to visit the Nufenenpass, it's one of the later passes of the entire Alps range to open (alongside the Stelvio, [which I visited in 2022]({{< ref "/travel/Italy/Velodrom_Italian_Job_2022/index.md" >}})). We actually weren't able to ride this pass when we visited in July of 2024, although we missed it only by one day.

Because public transit is just [so good in Switzerland]({{< ref "/travel/Switzerland/Transit/index.md" >}}), you will have options if one pass isn't open the particular day that you're out there. Usually there is a train or a bus that can take you back if something goes awry. But definitely do your planning, regardless!
