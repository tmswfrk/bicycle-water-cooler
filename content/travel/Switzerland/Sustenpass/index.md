# A Quintessential, Beautiful Climb
Out of all the climbs of the region, I think the [Sustenpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/o4ywk1yASnb5Mj4k8) had some of the most expansive views and certainly _the_ most amazing descent down the other side. It apparently was an old mule route that became modernized over time to help assist with transport of supplies during WWII, topping out at 2264 meters (7427 feet) above sea level.

If approaching the Sustenpass from [Wassen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VJmJMxXH69EieYfG7) like we did, it's a bit steeper and shorter, at about 7.2% and 11 miles (18 km). If coming from the other side near [Innertkirchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q1aAEL1GpfwWBzBU6), it's a bit less steep at 5.6%, but longer at 17 miles (28 km). 

We actually came into Andermatt from Interlaken the day before via a bus that went directly up and over the Sustenpass. This gave us an early glimpse into what it would be like to ride (while also getting quite a tour from our bus driver!). 

It's truly an amazing climb when coming from Andermatt, and while we didn't stop for pictures on the way up, I have incredible memories of snaking my way up the climb.

When coming from Andermatt, you actually descend very quickly through some car tunnels and switchbacks following the Reuss river through an amazing rock-lined valley. It was seriously amazing, so please don't skip this part and take the train if you're trying to save some mileage! Once reaching [Wassen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VJmJMxXH69EieYfG7), the official climb begins. After meandering through a few more tunnels, the road opens up and follows the outside of a large valley that just goes around and _up_.

The pass is reasonably well traveled, and I don't remember a ton of space being afforded to me as a cyclist, but the visibility along the road was really good and given that it's a major bus line, the traffic seems generally aware of hikers (yes, buses will stop for them at bus stops!), bikers, and other cars.

There are two large switchbacks towards the top, signifying that you're getting close. You'll also likely come across some snow, even in the height of summer!

At the top, you go through one final, short tunnel and end up at a parking lot, usually with several other cars or campers. You've made it!

# My Thoughts
I felt a certain affinity for the Sustenpass, probably because we first got to experience it from a commuter bus the day prior. The day was foggy, a bit wet, and very _moody_.

Definitely gave it a really interesting vibe, and also showcased to us that we slightly underestimated just how cold the mountains were going to be that time of the year. We promptly raided the sports gear stores in Andermatt once we arrived! Luckily, the weather was really nice the following day when we went up on our bikes. 

The first part of the ride deserves its own mention, the part where we descended quickly into Wassen and then climbed through several tunnels.

It was something out of another world! Referring back to Lord of the Rings again, it honestly felt a bit like [Rivendell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivendell) at times!

We didn't stop and did some good pacelining up the climb, so I definitely felt accomplished that day, somewhat differently than when I reached the top of the Furkapass the day prior. I made sure to get a picture of my bike with the wall of snow that had been piled high alongside the many beautiful cars that were sharing the parking lot with us at the top.

My favorite part though? The descent down the other side. 100%. It was probably _the longest_ descent I've ever done in my life. It was fast, smooth, and despite requiring an extended amount of focus time, I remember actively being shocked at just how much of it was spent in my "[flow state](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/flow-state)". 

The roads in Switzerland are just something of another caliber - in small amounts and at slower speeds they just seem like "nice roads", but you don't really fully appreciate them until you're on them for an extended period of time and at speed. It's especially apparently on the bike because you're just so much more connected to your surroundings. It's a bit difficult to describe here, but it's something every serious cyclist must experience in their lifetime.

It also was shocking to me at just how much uphill traffic was waiting that we observed from the other side. There were a few timed lights on the way down that definitely made for a slower ascent, so I'm really glad we did it the direction we did that day!

# Where to Go From Here
Of course, you can always just head back the way you came, but that gets tricky when considering riding back up the climb into Andermatt from Wassen. Not impossible of course, but the bike path along the road there looks quite narrow and the road itself can get quite busy around the switchbacks. So it may be best to continue onward and experience more of the big climbs of Swizerland.

Based on my experience, I'd recommend:

- Descending down the west side towards [Innertkirchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2vVoLJFErSVYjEy9), climbing up and over the [Grimselpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JgLpP5Nwki7PXHbc8), and then back up and over the [Furkapass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EKnQyDBXaEZpxzBK8) to Andermatt.
- Do the same route as above, but take [Nufenenpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZyPDdG7LBXhs17Hh6) over towards [Gotthardpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/96ac6XP9DQPQsb9x5) and back up and over (a huge day, although you could take the train back from [Airolo](https://www.strava.com/activities/11807436528) at that point).
- Head over the [Grimselpass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JgLpP5Nwki7PXHbc8), but continue down towards [Oberwald](https://maps.app.goo.gl/46iKHWwAEWGbvyFU6) and take the train back to [Hospental](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NG7Uz54SmAxGSesM8) towards Andermatt.
- To shorten the ride, head down into [Innertkirchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2vVoLJFErSVYjEy9) and take public transit back to Andermatt, either via a direct bus or a train (or set of trains) around towards [GÃ¶schenen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7fWwGkfRzaoQ9xPq9) and Andermatt.
