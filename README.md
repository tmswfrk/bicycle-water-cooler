# GitHub Repository for the Bicycle Water Cooler
BWC is a static website built entirely upon using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/), which is a Golang-based static website generator.

## What's in this Repo?
This repo contains source code, templates, and a lot of blog content. Since it's fully allocated here, the website can be rebuilt and hosted elsewhere in the event that I need to do so.

## What is the Bicycle Water Cooler?
It's your go-to source for long and short form content for all things bike-related. It started as a passion project in 2020 when most of us were locked up inside for a while. I'm an avid cyclist and love to share my knowledge and experiences with all those who find it interesting.
